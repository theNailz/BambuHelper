# BambuHelper

Dedicated Bambu Lab printer monitor built with ESP32-S3 Super Mini and a 1.54" 240x240 color TFT display (ST7789).

Connects to your printer via MQTT over TLS and displays a real-time dashboard with arc gauges, animations, live stats, and optional buzzer notifications.

Beta support for CYD 320x240 displays is also available.

### Supported Printers

| Connection Mode | Printers | How it connects |
|---|---|---|
| **LAN Direct** | P1P, P1S, X1, X1C, X1E, A1, A1 Mini | Local MQTT via printer IP + LAN access code |
| **Bambu Cloud (All printers)** | Any Bambu printer | Cloud MQTT via access token - no LAN mode needed |

> **Tip:** Use "Bambu Cloud (All printers)" if you don't want to enable LAN mode on your printer (for example to keep Bambu Handy working), if your ESP32 is on a different network than the printer, or if your printer only supports cloud mode (H2C, H2D, H2S, P2S).

### Cloud Mode Security Notice

When using Bambu Cloud, BambuHelper connects through Bambu Lab's cloud MQTT service. Here is what you need to know:

- **No credentials are stored** - BambuHelper never asks for your email or password. You extract an access token from your browser and paste it into the web interface.
- **Only the access token is stored** in the ESP32's flash memory. This token expires after about 3 months, at which point you simply paste a new one.
- **Read-only access** - BambuHelper only reads printer status. It never sends commands or modifies printer settings.
- **Same approach as other community projects** - this is the same authentication method used by the [Home Assistant Bambu Lab integration](https://github.com/greghesp/ha-bambulab), [OctoPrint-Bambu](https://github.com/jneilliii/OctoPrint-BambuPrinter), and other trusted third-party tools.

## CYD Display Support (Beta)

| Preview | Notes |
|---|---|
| ![CYD display](img/CYD.png) | **CYD / ESP32-2432S028** support is available and currently **beta**. This is the larger `320x240` display version. Flashing is done the same way as the standard `240x240` build, but on [ESP Web Flasher](https://espressif.github.io/esptool-js/) you should set **Baudrate: 115200** before clicking **Connect**. This low baudrate note is for **CYD only**. The standard ESP32-S3 240x240 version does not require this change. Tested behavior so far: The first connection attempt may fail - click **Disconnect** in the web tool, then **Connect** again and it should work on the second try. **Do not physically unplug the USB cable between attempts** - just use the buttons in the web flasher. [Use this firmware](https://github.com/Keralots/BambuHelper/blob/main/firmware/v2.4-CYD/BambuHelper-CYD-WebFlasher-v2.4.bin) |

## Features

- **Optional buzzer** - passive buzzer notifications for print finished, connected, and error events
- **OTA updates** - firmware can be updated from the web interface
- **CYD display support (beta)** - support for ESP32-2432S028 / 320x240 displays
- **Exponential backoff** - reconnect attempts to offline printers gradually slow down to conserve resources

## Hardware

| Component | Specification |
|---|---|
| MCU | ESP32-S3 Super Mini |
| Display | 1.54" TFT SPI ST7789 (240x240) |
| Optional display | CYD / ESP32-2432S028, 320x240 ILI9341 (beta) |
| Connection | SPI |

Display: 1.54": https://a.aliexpress.com/_EG9y7wc

ESP32-S3 SuperMini: https://a.aliexpress.com/_Eyk9GdA  (Make sure you purchase S3 variant!)

Optional: TTP223 touch button or standard push button for multi-printer switching (auto printer switching works without a button anyway; change settings in the web interface): TTP223 link: https://aliexpress.com/item/1005006246380749.html

Optional: Passive buzzer for print finish and error notifications: https://aliexpress.com/item/1005008825917787.html

Optional case seen on picture (for ST7789 (240x240) display): https://makerworld.com/en/models/2501721

### Default Wiring

| Display Pin ST7789 (240x240) | ESP32-S3 GPIO |
|---|---|
| MOSI (SDA) | 11 |
| SCLK (SCL) | 12 |
| CS | 10 |
| DC | 9 |
| RST | 8 |
| BL | 13 |
| GND | GND |
| VCC | 3.3V |

Adjust pin assignments in `platformio.ini` `build_flags` to match your wiring.

Touch TTP223 button is optional. It is used to switch between printers. You may also use a standard push button and connect it between pin 4 and GND, then pick the correct button type in the web interface under Multi-Printer support.

### Optional Buzzer Wiring

The buzzer is completely optional. If you do not connect one, BambuHelper works normally.

Use a **passive buzzer** and connect it like this:

| Buzzer Pin | ESP32 GPIO |
|---|---|
| `+` / `SIG` | `GPIO 5` by default |
| `-` / `GND` | `GND` |

You can change the buzzer GPIO later in the web interface under **Buzzer**. The buzzer can be used for print-finished, connected, and error notifications.

## Setup

### Configuration Guide

[![Configuration Guide](https://img.youtube.com/vi/n2RdbeHTMz0/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/n2RdbeHTMz0)

1. **Flash** the firmware (see above)
2. **Connect** to the `BambuHelper-XXXX` WiFi network (password: `bambu1234`)
3. **Open** `192.168.4.1` in your browser
4. **Enter** your home WiFi credentials and **Save** - the device restarts and connects to your WiFi
5. **Note the IP address** shown on the ESP32 display after it connects to WiFi
6. **Open** that IP address in your browser to access the full web interface
7. **Configure your printer:**

   **LAN Direct** (P1P, P1S, X1, X1C, X1E, A1, A1 Mini):
   - Printer IP address (found in printer Settings > Network)
   - Serial number (see note below)
   - LAN access code (8 characters, from printer Settings > Network)

   **Bambu Cloud (All printers)**:
   - Get your Bambu Cloud access token from your browser (see [Getting a Cloud Token](#getting-a-cloud-token) below)
   - Paste the token into the web interface
   - Enter your printer's serial number (see note below)

   > **Important: Serial number is NOT the printer name.** The serial number is a 15-character code (for example `01P00A000000000`) found on the printer LCD under **Settings > Device > Serial Number**, or on the physical label on the back or bottom of the printer. Do not confuse it with the printer name shown in Bambu Studio (for example `3DP-01P-110`), which is a shortened version and will not work.

8. **Save Printer Settings** - the device connects to your printer

### Getting a Cloud Token

To use cloud mode, you need an access token from your Bambu Lab account. There are two ways to get it:

**Using browser DevTools (Chrome / Edge):**
1. Open https://bambulab.com and log in to your account
2. Press **F12** to open DevTools
3. Go to the **Application** tab (click `>>` if you do not see it)
4. In the left sidebar, expand **Cookies** -> click `https://bambulab.com`
5. Find the row named `token` in the cookie list
6. Double-click the **Value** cell to select it, then **Ctrl+C** to copy
7. Paste the value into BambuHelper's "Access Token" field in the web interface

**Using browser DevTools (Firefox):**
1. Open https://bambulab.com and log in to your account
2. Press **F12** to open DevTools
3. Go to the **Storage** tab
4. In the left sidebar, expand **Cookies** -> click `https://bambulab.com`
5. Find the row named `token`
6. Double-click the **Value** cell to select it, then **Ctrl+C** to copy
7. Paste the value into BambuHelper's "Access Token" field

**Using browser DevTools (Safari):**
1. Open https://bambulab.com and log in to your account
2. Open **Develop** -> **Show Web Inspector** (enable the Develop menu first in Safari Preferences -> Advanced)
3. Go to the **Storage** tab -> **Cookies** -> `bambulab.com`
4. Find and copy the `token` value
5. Paste it into BambuHelper's "Access Token" field

**Using the Python helper script (recommended):**
```bash
pip install curl_cffi
python tools/get_token.py
```
The script will prompt for your email, password, and 2FA code, then print the token. Copy and paste it into BambuHelper's web interface.

> **Note:** The token is valid for approximately 3 months. When it expires, the ESP32 will fail to connect - simply repeat the process above to get a fresh token and paste it in the web interface. Make sure to select the correct **Server Region** (US/EU/CN) to match your Bambu account's region.

## Web Interface

The built-in web interface (accessible at the device's IP address) provides the following settings:

### WiFi Settings
- **SSID** - your home WiFi network name

## Dashboard Screens

| Screen | When |
|---|---|
| Splash | Boot (2 seconds) |
| AP Mode | First boot / no WiFi configured |
| Connecting WiFi | Attempting WiFi connection |
| WiFi Connected | Shows IP for 3 seconds (if enabled) |
| Connecting Printer | WiFi connected, waiting for MQTT |
| Idle | Connected, printer not printing |
| Printing | Active print with full dashboard |
| Finished | Print complete with animation (auto-off after timeout) |
| Clock | After finish timeout (if enabled) - shows digital clock with date |
| Display Off | After finish timeout (if clock disabled) or printer powered off |

## Display Power Management

- After a print completes, the finish screen is shown for a configurable duration (default: 3 minutes), then either a digital clock is displayed or the screen turns off (configurable).
- When the printer is powered off or disconnected, the display stays in its current state (clock or off).
- When the printer comes back online or starts a new print, the display automatically wakes up.
- The "Keep display always on" option overrides the auto-off behavior.
- The "Show clock after print" option (enabled by default) shows time and date instead of turning off the display.

- **Cloud mode:** Bambu Lab account, ESP32 with internet access

## Multi-Printer Monitoring

BambuHelper supports monitoring up to 2 printers simultaneously via dual MQTT connections.

### Rotation Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **Smart** (default) | Shows the printing printer. If both are printing, cycles between them. If neither is printing, shows last active. |
| **Auto-rotate** | Cycles through all connected printers at a configurable interval (10s - 10min). |
| **Off** | Manually switch between printers using the physical button only. |

### Physical Button

An optional physical button can be connected to cycle between printers and wake the display from sleep.

| Type | Wiring | How it works |
|---|---|---|
| **Push button** | One pin to configured GPIO, other pin to GND | Active LOW with internal pull-up |
| **TTP223 touch sensor** | VCC->3.3V, GND->GND, SIG->configured GPIO | Active HIGH |

The button type and GPIO pin are configurable in the web interface (Multi-Printer section) - no recompilation needed.

### MQTT Reconnect Backoff

When a printer is physically powered off, BambuHelper uses exponential backoff to avoid wasting resources on repeated connection attempts:

| Phase | Attempts | Interval |
|---|---|---|
| Normal | First 5 | Every 10 seconds |
| Phase 2 | Next 10 | Every 60 seconds |
| Phase 3 | Beyond 15 | Every 120 seconds |

When the printer comes back online, the backoff resets to normal immediately.

## Power Monitoring *(initial support, beta)*

| | |
|---|---|
| ![Power Monitoring](img/PowerMonitoring.png) | BambuHelper can display live power consumption from a **[Tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/)-flashed smart plug** connected to your printer. Tasmota is open-source firmware for ESP-based smart plugs that exposes a local HTTP API and MQTT - no cloud required.<br><br>**What it shows:**<br>- Live wattage in the bottom status bar on the idle and printing screens<br>- Total kWh used during the print job, shown on the "Print Complete" screen<br><br>**Setup:** open the web interface, go to **Power Monitoring**, enter the plug's local IP address, set your preferred poll interval (10-30s), and choose whether to alternate the watts display with the layer counter or always show watts.<br><br>**Requirements:** any Tasmota-flashed smart plug with energy monitoring (e.g. Sonoff S31, BlitzWolf BW-SHP6, Nous A1). The plug must be on your local network and reachable from the ESP32. No Tasmota MQTT broker needed - BambuHelper polls the HTTP API directly.<br><br>*This is initial/beta support. Future plans include automatic printer power-off based on nozzle temperature and idle time.* |

## Troubleshooting

### WiFi won't connect / drops frequently

**SPI display cables near the ESP32 antenna can cause WiFi interference.** The ESP32-S3 Super Mini has a PCB antenna at one end of the board. If the SPI wires to the display run close to or over this antenna area, RF interference can prevent WiFi from connecting or cause frequent disconnections.

**Fix:** Route the display cables away from the antenna end of the ESP32-S3. Even 1-2 cm of separation can make a significant difference. If using a breadboard, ensure the wires do not loop back over the ESP32 module.

**Symptoms:**
- "Connecting to WiFi" screen appears briefly, then falls back to AP mode
- WiFi connects sometimes but drops after a few seconds
- Works fine when display is disconnected

**If WiFi issues persist**
Perform an antenna mod by soldering two individual goldpins to the antenna pads, as shown in the picture.

![wiring](img/antenamod.png)

### Printer shows "Connecting" but never connects

- **LAN Direct:** Make sure the printer and ESP32 are on the same network. Check that LAN mode is enabled on the printer and the access code is correct.
- **Bambu Cloud:** Verify the access token has not expired (about 3 months validity). Re-extract it from your browser and paste it again. Check the server region matches your Bambu account.
- If a printer is physically powered off, reconnect attempts will gradually slow down (backoff). It will reconnect automatically when the printer comes back online.

### Display shows wrong printer / does not switch

- Check rotation mode in the web interface (Multi-Printer section). Smart mode only switches automatically when a printer is actively printing.
- Press the physical button (if configured) to manually cycle between printers.

## Future Plans

- Multi-language support
